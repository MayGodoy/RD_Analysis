# RD_Analysis

This analysis is my final project for the Data Science Bootcamp. An analysis of Roller Derby - a contact sport -  mostly played by women around the world using the WFTDA regulations. 
I scrapped the info from 2 sites differently, the WFTDA and the Flat Track Stats pages. There are two main datasets the Historical Rank of the WFTDA -from 2013 to 2019 taking a sample every three months- and the sanctioned games played in 2019.
It's important to say that the only data collected it's the data from the sanctioned games played in the WFTDA. These matches are reviewed by WFTDA Games officials before they are granted sanctioning, and the results of the bout count towards the leagues' ranking. Due to differences in league structures, most leagues (WFTDA and non-WFTDA) play non-sanctioned matches between local home teams or between teams from different leagues, and that matches aren't registered so it's hard to say how many games are played by non-WFTDA member leagues.
**It's important to say the datasets are not included in the folder.**

In the data historical most of the data is numerical except by the name and the location (city, country, region)
